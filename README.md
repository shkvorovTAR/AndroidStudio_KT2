English: you must write a program where the user can input a persons name into a listview
and be able to delete the name from the list, when clicking on said name.
The view you’ll see when you long click on a name in the listview.
A dialog window will open up and you can choose to delete the name
or cancel the action. The AlertDialog has a title – delete, a positivebutton – yes and a
negativebutton – cancel
